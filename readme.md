# The Sleeping Prince

Grimm's tale retold gender-neutral.


## Why

- state-of-the-art;
  - the king is a man
  - the bad wise woman is... a woman, or a witch, but always female
  - the royal couple is a hetero couple (we already have that magic frog...)
- I didn't change all the genders to make up for / avoid some sexist situations
- it's a fairy tale, but kids grow up with it and learn from it

Having two daughters and wanting to read them the tales I have been listening to as a kid,
but without these tales being a bad role model for them.

## How

I had problems finding appropriate counterparts for some words: maiden,
"Kings' and Queens' sons and daughters"...

## TODO

can we make it more smooth, did all the vocabulary go right?
